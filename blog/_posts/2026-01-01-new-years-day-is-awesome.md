# Q1 Update
I've been meaning to spin up something that is not related to any of my ventures, just about the tech that is changing so rapidly.

### Simplicity
**[RenderCV](https://github.com/rendercv/rendercv)** and **[Slidev](https://sli.dev/)** will continue to replace my dependence on Microsoft 365 Co-Pilot, and now GSuite where I can get away with it. Example of the resume is linked on the main site, slidev I haven't had a reason yet to publish outside the day job.

### Terminal Love
As I havent' decided to pay for *[Warp Terminal](https://www.warp.dev/)*,  I gave *[ghostty](https://ghostty.org/)* a try and was pleasantly surprised at 'Life is Simple" coming back - it works great with amp / kilo.

### Nerd-holing
I also cracked on with a *[tap-group auto-creator](https://github.com/NickJLange/Firefox_Tab_Group_Bulk_Ops)* via https://github.com/NickJLange/Firefox_Tab_Group_Bulk_Ops, and have attempted to publish it on Firefox Extensions. So I have 500 grouped tabs now, which is better than 500 tabs across 11 windows. I'll be looking for some way to export that to other systems.



I have spent some time taking notes / thoughts on information organization and viscosity which I'll turn into something on [5L](https://5l-labs.com) later this week hopefully.

### Progress
Finally, I spent some time to get 5L turning up *[Recruiter Ranking](https://recruiter-rankings.com)*, despite the fact that a lot of this has been vibe coded...

Let's see where this goes in the New Year.
