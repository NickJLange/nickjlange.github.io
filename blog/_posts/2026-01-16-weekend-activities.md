# Weekend Recap

This weekend was a mix of productivity and relaxation.

## Saturday Morning

Started the day with a long run along the usual route. The weather was crisp but clear - perfect running conditions. Managed to beat my personal best time by a good margin.

## Afternoon Projects

Spent a few hours working on some open source contributions. Finally had time to dig into that tab group bulk creator project I've been meaning to polish up. Made some good progress on the export functionality.

## Sunday

Took it easier on Sunday. Caught up on some reading and experimented with a new terminal setup. Ghostty continues to impress - it's become my daily driver.

### Books Finished This Week

- Finished "The Pragmatic Programmer" - still holds up remarkably well after all these years
- Started reading about systems design patterns

## Looking Ahead

The week ahead looks busy but manageable. Planning to:
- Continue the open source work
- Maybe prototype that new feature I've been sketching out
- Get back to the gym consistently

That's the weekend wrap-up. Nothing too exciting, but productive enough.
